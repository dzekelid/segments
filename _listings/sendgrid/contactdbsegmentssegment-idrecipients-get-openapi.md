      description: "**This endpoint allows you to create a segment.**\n\nAll recipients
        in your contactdb will be added or removed automatically depending on whether
        they match the criteria for this segment.\n\nList Id:\n\n* Send this to segment
        from an existing list\n* Don't send this in order to segment from your entire
        contactdb.\n\nValid operators for create and update depend on the type of
        the field you are segmenting: \n\n* **Dates:** \"eq\", \"ne\", \"lt\" (before),
        \"gt\" (after) \n* **Text:** \"contains\", \"eq\" (is - matches the full field),
        \"ne\" (is not - matches any field where the entire field is not the condition
        value) \n* **Numbers:** \"eq\", \"lt\", \"gt\" \n* **Email Clicks and Opens:**
        \"eq\" (opened), \"ne\" (not opened) \n\nSegment conditions using \"eq\" or
        \"ne\" for email clicks and opens should provide a \"field\" of either *clicks.campaign_identifier*
        or *opens.campaign_identifier*. The condition value should be a string containing
        the id of a completed campaign. \n\nSegments may contain multiple condtions,
        joined by an \"and\" or \"or\" in the \"and_or\" field. The first condition
        in the conditions list must have an empty \"and_or\", and subsequent conditions
        must all specify an \"and_or\".\n\nThe Contacts API helps you manage your
