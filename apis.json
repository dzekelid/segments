First, AWS Mobile Hub guides you through the process to integrate the AWS Mobile SDK with your app. Next, you define your target segments, campaign message, and specify the delivery schedule. Once your campaign is running, Pinpoint provides metrics so you can run analytics and track the impact of your campaign.With Amazon Pinpoint, there are no upfront setup costs, and no fixed monthly cost. You only pay for the number of users your campaign targets, the messages you send, and the events you collect, so you can start small and scale as your application grows.",
